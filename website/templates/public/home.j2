            <p>TO JESSICA DE SILVA'S HOMEPAGE</p>
        </header>
        <p>Hi, thank you for checking out my page! My name is Dr. Jessica De Silva and I have been at <a
                href="https://www.csustan.edu">California State University, Stanislaus</a> since 2018 where I am
            currently an Associate Professor of Mathematics. About 15 minutes away is the little town of Hilmar where I
            grew up. Known locally for its school spirit, out-of-towners may have heard of Hilmar for its claim to fame
            of being home of the Hilmar Cheese Company. This company's Hilmar facility produces more cheese per year
            from a single site than any other cheese manufacturer in the world!
        </p>
        <p>I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from Stanislaus State, and my M.S. and Ph.D. both in Mathematics from the <a
                href="https://www.unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>. My research background is in
            combinatorics in graph theory, and my current interests lie in applications of discrete mathematics in data
            science and image processing. I have had the opportunity to mentor many fantastic research students through
            <a href="https://www.csustan.edu/AMP/join">CSU-LSAMP</a> and Stan State's <a
                href="https://www.csustan.edu/STEM-success/research-and-immersion-stem-excellence">RISE</a> program.
            Read about their projects under the Research section on the left menu.
        </p>
        <p>Although research is one of my favorite pastimes, teaching is where I find my passion for this career. I have
            had great math teachers throughout my childhood and this certainly influenced my choice to study
            mathematics. My goal in the classroom is to be approachable, engaging, and to have a contageous positive
            attitude towards mathematics. As a Stan State faculty member, I have had the pleasure of teaching some of
            the most dedicated, successful, and motivated students at the university. Read about what they're up to
            under the Student News section.</p>

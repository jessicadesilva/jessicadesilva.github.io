            <p>My life outside of mathematics was pretty minimal during graduate school, but now that I have settled
                into my career I've picked up some of those "hobbies" that people ask you about during icebreakers :). I
                have always enjoyed working out and watching YouTube. Sometimes those interests go hand-in-hand as I
                following many bodybuilding YouTubers--I very much admire their dedication to the sport! Now that we
                have moved back to California and I have a life-sized kitchen, I started cooking quite a bit using
                recipes from <a href="seriouseats.com">Serious Eats</a> and the <a
                    href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>.
                Since quarantine started, my partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulo-s-costa/">Paulo</a>
                moved back to Turlock from the Bay Area to work from home. He's been my cooking partner and...let's just
                say thank goodness because he is somehow immune to the tears caused by cutting onions! We love to hike
                together and even went on our first backpacking trip with our "quarantine pod" in Summer 2020 at <a

            <p>Paulo grew up in Turlock, so we enjoy seeing our families every weekend. Both of our parents have
                Portuguese roots, specifically from the group of islands off the coast of Portugal called the <a

                time after the pandemic!

    <h3>Graduate School Rambles</h3>
    <p>I wrote this little bit as a graduate student when I was on the job market. Enjoy!</p>
    <p>My mom is a <i>huge</i> fan of to-do lists. She scribbles words in the tiniest font on multiple pieces of scratch
        paper, held together (with her coupons) by a paper clip. These lists say things like 'pull the weeds,' 'pay
        bills,' and 'ladies day flowers.' There's a separate paper for the weekly grocery list and we often spend too
        much time trying to figure out if a scribble says 'milk' or 'mayo.' She also has separate columns that say
        'Jessica,' 'Jason' [my brother], and 'Manuel' [my dad] with our corresponding to-do lists. You'd think that
        after moving away and starting graduate school I had forgotten about her lists, but that is far from the truth!
        Five years later and her phone calls never fail to start with her saying "Now I have a list for you..."
    </p>
    <p>I have found myself making my own to-do lists in various forms. One of my most unique to-do lists is the section
        on my CV that is commented out. I started this as a junior in undergrad and since I wanted to go to graduate
        school, those commented items would say things like "%REU program," "%publish a paper," "%present at
        conferences." Some of these are still on my current CV (e.g., "%publish more papers"), and I have definitely
        added new ones "%mentor undergraduates," "%write agrant proposal," "%get my Ph.D." etc. Sometimes I didn't know
        what I should add, so I would look up the CVs of other people and see if there was anything they did that I also
        wanted to do some day. But everything on that list was on there for a reason, and the reason was that it would
        help me achieve whatever goal I had set for myself. Just like in the grocery store when you have your shopping
        list, you use it so you don't forget to buy more dish soap but also to deter you from buying that super awesome
        coffee cup that you really don't need. By having this list I was able to keep focused on what I needed to do and
        I was motivated by knowing everything I was doing had a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>The goals I had set for myself at the start of graduate school was to get my Ph.D. and nail a tenure-track
        position. Goals definitely change (especially over the course of five years), but these goals of mine have
        stayed put. I am approaching the end of my graduate career and as I look towards the future I realized I need to
        start creating my to-do list as a tenure-track professor of mathematics (*knock on wood* that I can call myself
        this next fall). My to-do list hasn't necessarily gotten longer, but it has gotten denser because this list will
        help me achieve goals that go far beyond myself. This time around I have set goals that will hopefully make an
        impact on the rest of the world as well.
    </p>
    <p>I am on the job market this year and part of the process of developing an application is to write a cover letter.
        Now most application materials are generic, in the sense that you write one teaching statement, one research
        statement, and one CV. But the cover letter is really where you *should* tailor it to the specific position and
        department you are applying to. This letter to the search committee, probably best referred to as a 'Letter of
        Interest,' is an opportunity for you to tell them not only why you are qualified for the position, but also why
        you are interested in working in their department. I have written a good number of cover letters so far
        (although still few compared to how many are left to do) and I learned a lot about what my professional goals
        are through this process.
    </p>
    <p>If I haven't already learned about the department through people I know who work(ed) there, then my primary
        source of information is their website and, in particular, individual faculty webpages. Faculty pages give me an
        idea of what it would be like to work at that university, and I believe their CVs also reflect what the
        department values. I have come across a few pages that have made me think "I want to do things like that." and
        those instances have helped me shape the type of professor I want to become.
    </p>
    <p>As a mathematician, I want to work on (and solve) fun problems, publish papers, and have a long list of
        collaborators at various places, both geographically and within their mathematical career. I plan on writing
        (and hopefully being awarded) internal and external grants to support my research, organize conferences, and
        develop programs to support underrepresented students. At conferences, I want to be the faculty member who
        purposely sits with students to learn all about them, offer advice, and to be a contact for any future
        questions/opportunities. I wish to provide service to my community in many ways, but certainly by working with
        future generations of mathematicians in primary and secondary schools. Above all, I want my students to know me
        for being an outstanding teacher and mentor. I know these are lofty goals, and I don't expect that I will
        achieve them within the first ten years of my career. Nevertheless I am excited to be starting this journey on
        my way to becoming a person who will make an impact.
    </p>
    <p>I have also decided to write this at this time to show that my goals do not need to be a function of the position
        I will start in the fall. Too often is it the case that I tell someone I am seriously interested in a school
        where 4-4 is the teaching load and they tell me that teaching will then be the only thing I do. Now of course,
        that doesn't sound terrible for I am in this profession because I love to teach, but I believe that I will be
        able to attain these goals no matter where I go. This belief partly stems from the fact that I have met people
        who model what I want to become and it didn't matter if they were teaching a 4-4 or a 3-2, at a small school or
        a large school, at a private or public institution. Surely it will take me longer to achieve these goals at some
        places over others, but as long as I am supported in these endeavors I have no doubt that I will accomplish
        them.
